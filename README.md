# ShareSci
ShareSci is a research publication publication and discussion website, currently being developed as a school project by Mike D'Arcy and Utkarsh Patel. We aim to make it easier for researchers to find papers related to their field of study, to discuss the contributions and flaws of studies, and to publish their own studies (even negative results).
